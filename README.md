# JetsProject

##Description

The JetsApplication encapsulates the management and operations of a fleet of jets inside of an airfield. Provides a user interface through the console to interact with several functions related to jets, including listing the fleet, flying all jets, and viewing the fastest jet.

##Lessons Learned

1. **Polymorphism and Inheritance:**
I used polymorphism and inheritance to create a unified interface for different types of jets, allowing for flexibility and extensibility in managing the fleet.

2. **Code Modularity:**
I worked on modularity by breaking down functions into methods like listFleet, flyAllJets, and others, helping with code organization and reusability.

##Tech Used

- **Java:** The core programming language used for developing the application.
- **Scanner:** Java utility class used for taking user input.
- **Git:** Version control system for tracking changes in the source code.
- **GitHub:** Hosting service for version control and collaboration.

##Usage
**1.** Clone this repository.
**2.** Navigate to the project dirctory.
**3.** Compile and run the application. 
**4.** Follow the on screen menu prompts to interact with the fleet of jets.
